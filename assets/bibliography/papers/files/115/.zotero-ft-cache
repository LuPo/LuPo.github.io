ABSTRACT

A new Lucanicum species, L. ashworthianum Majewska, K.Robert & Van de Vijver sp. nov ., was found in multiple samples of biofilm growing on loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta and their symbiotic barnacles Chelonibia testudinaria collected on the beaches of Kosi Bay, eastern coast of South Africa, during the two nesting seasons (the austral summers of 2017/2018 and 2018/2019). The new species possesses several features typical of the genus Lucanicum , including the uniseriate striae composed of one large macroareola, the presence of large apical slit fields and transapically elongated rimoportulae at both poles, and a cingulum composed of numerous open, doubly perforated copulae. It differs from the only other Lucanicum species known to date, the coral-associated L. concatenatum , in having considerably smaller cells with clearly rostrate or sub-capitate apices and internal rimoportula opening composed of a C-shaped inner lip and an oval, flap-like outer lip – a feature not observed previously in Lucanicum . Based on these new observations, an amendment of the genus description is proposed.

Introduction

It is a well-agreed fact that even the relatively easily accessible shallow-water marine habitats harbour a difficult to assess, though likely very high, number of yet undescribed organisms. The discovery of novel taxa is, however, inevitably limited by the inconsistent and uneven sampling effort. Recent studies clearly show that rarely explored marine substrata, such as carapaces and skin of sea turtles, may constitute excellent and ecologically unique habitats for a range of macro- and micro-organisms not observed on other types of surfaces (Hollenberg 1971 ; Monroe and Limpus 1979 ; Serio et al. 2011 ; Frankovich et al. 2015 , 2016 ; Majewska et al. 2015 , 2017a , 2018 , 2019 ).

Diatom communities constitute an essential element of the sea turtle microflora (Majewska et al. 2017b , 2018 ), though many of the observed taxa remain unidentified and undescribed. Identifying members of epibiont communities allows us to characterize the epibioses, which can inform on ecology and migration patterns of the host as well as biogeography and evolutionary relationships among epi- and basibionts (Robinson et al. 2016 ). Epizoic organisms include both the truly epizoic taxa (i.e. species that require the substratum of an animal host) and opportunistic species that live in the surrounding planktonic or benthic environments and are occasionally transferred to the biofilm. Truly epizoic taxa may be associated with a specific host species, or may thrive on a group of closely related species, and are likely well-adapted to, or dependent on, the microhabitat sculptured by host animal physiology. Opportunistic taxa may show host specificity as well, as different host species and populations exhibit different feeding behaviours and migration patterns bringing them in contact with different surrounding environments. The number of specialized truly epizoic sea turtle-associated taxa may be significantly lower than that of opportunistic taxa that originate from a larger pool of species in a diverse and more variable surrounding environment. The proportion of these two groups is currently unknown on sea turtles, and our knowledge is limited by the largely incomplete characterization of the epizoic flora.

The diatom genus Lucanicum Lobban & Ashworth was originally described, and has so far been only observed, on living blue corals ( Heliopora coerulea Pallas 1766) inhabiting the benthic ecosystems in the vicinity of Guam, western Pacific. The genus is characterised by having linear valves with broadly rounded apices, uniseriate striae composed of one macroareola, well-developed apical slit fields at both poles, the presence of one rimoportula with equal labia at each apex, and numerous copulae showing two rows of slits (Lobban and Ashworth 2014a ). Based on available morphological and molecular data, it was tentatively placed within Cyclophorales (Cyclophoraceae) as the phylogenetic analysis indicated its close relationship to other araphid genera such as Astrosyne Ashworth & Lobban, Cyclophora Castracane, and Florella J.N.Navarro (Lobban and Ashworth 2014a ).

The present study describes a second species of Lucanicum, L. ashworthianum Majewska, K.Robert & Van de Vijver, sp. nov ., found in multiple biofilm samples, collected from loggerhead sea turtles ( Caretta caretta L.) and their commensal barnacles ( Chelonibia testudinaria L.) (Zardus and Hadfield 2004 ) during two nesting seasons on the beaches of Kosi Bay, iSimangaliso Wetland Park, eastern coast of South Africa. The new taxon bears a clear resemblance to the only other currently known member of the genus, L. concatenatum Lobban & Ashworth, but exhibits a few distinct features that justify its description as a new species (Lobban and Ashworth 2014a ). Upon the description of this novel species and additional morphological observations, the original description of the genus Lucanicum is emended.
Materials and methods
Sampling site

Biofilm and barnacle samples examined in this study were collected from the carapaces of egg-laying loggerhead sea turtles on the beaches of Kosi Bay (Indian Ocean), South Africa during the two consecutive nesting seasons in December 2017, December 2018, and January 2019. Observed sea turtles were encountered and examined for epibionts during the night monitoring patrols along the beach within a circa 6-km stretch north from the Bhanga Nek field station, a zone with the highest density of the loggerhead nests in South Africa (Nel et al. 2013 ). Here, on the northern beaches of iSimangaliso Wetland Park, the South African sea turtle monitoring programme is successfully conducted since 1973 (Nel et al. 2013 ).
Diatom material collection and processing

Epizoic diatom samples were collected from the lateral and posterior parts of the sea turtle carapaces. Each time, approximately 20–25 % of the carapace was vigorously brushed with a single-use toothbrush to remove the carapace-associated diatom biofilm. After collection, the material was placed in separate 50 ml plastic tubes and preserved immediately in 70 % ethanol solution following the sampling protocol proposed by Pinou et al. ( 2019 ). When present, barnacles were carefully detached from the carapace using a plastic paint scraper or a blunt knife, placed in separate plastic bags, and frozen (−20°C) after returning to the field station, i.e. within 1–6h of collection. All materials were taken by, or under close supervision, of highly qualified researchers. The procedures involved in this study respect ethical standards in the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 2013 ) and all applicable national laws.

In total, 65 barnacle and 156 (skin and carapace) biofilm samples collected from 78 loggerhead sea turtles were analysed for diatoms. To detach diatoms from the barnacle surface, frozen barnacle samples were placed in separate glass beakers with ca. 25-50 ml of distilled water and sonicated for 30 minutes in a Transsonic T310 (Elma, Singen, Germany) ultrasound bath following the protocol previously used by Majewska et al. ( 2018 ). Subsequently, the barnacles were removed from the beakers and the remaining liquid was left under the fume hood for ca. 24h, which allowed a significant reduction of the sample volume. To remove all organic matter from both carapace and barnacle samples, small portions of diatom material were digested with a mixture of boiling concentrated acid (55 % nitric acid and 98 % sulphuric acid added at a 2:1 volume ratio) following a slightly modified method by von Stosch (Hasle and Syvertsen 1997 ). The boiling time ranged from ca. 3 to 15 min depending on the amount of organic matter present in the sample. Digested material was then rinsed with deionized water and centrifuged several times at 1400 x g (2500 rpm in a rotor with radius[max] 20 cm) to remove the excess acid. For light microscopy (LM) analysis, permanent slides were prepared using Naphrax® and observed under an Olympus BX53 microscope, equipped with Differential Interference Contrast (Nomarski) and the Olympus UC30 Imaging System. Samples and slides are deposited in the South African Diatom Collection housed by North-West University (South Africa) and the BR-collection housed by Meise Botanic Garden (Belgium). For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), portions of the cleaned diatom material were filtered through a 1.2-μm Isopore™ polycarbonate membrane filter (Merck Millipore) that were then mounted on aluminium stubs with carbon tape. The stubs were sputter-coated with a gold-palladium layer of ca. 20 nm and examined with a JEOL JSM-7001F FEG scanning electron microscope at 3 kV (Centre for High Resolution Electron Microscopy, Nelson Mandela University, Port Elizabeth, South Africa).

Diatom terminology used in the current paper follows Ross et al. ( 1979 ), Round et al. ( 1990 ), and Lobban and Ashworth ( 2014a ). The morphology of the new taxon has been compared with the ultrastructure of the other known Lucanicum species (Lobban and Ashworth 2014a ) and several related araphid diatom genera, currently placed within Cyclophorales Round & Crawford, emend. Lobban & Ashworth such as Cyclophora Castracane and Neosynedra D.M.Williams & Round.

Type locality

Kosi Bay, iSimangaliso Wetland Park, South Africa (26º 59ʹ 38.9” S, 32º 51ʹ 59.8” E). Collected from the carapace of a nesting loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta (tag numbers ZA0447D, ZA0427D), by F. De Ridder, 16 January 2018
Etymology

The specific epithet honours Dr Matt P. Ashworth (The University of Texas at Austin, USA), the co-author of the genus, in recognition of his important contribution to marine and epizoic diatom research.
Ecology

Lucanicum ashworthianum was found in multiple biofilm samples collected from carapaces of loggerhead sea turtles and their associated barnacles ( Chelonibia testudinaria ) during two nesting seasons in Kosi Bay, eastern coast of South Africa. The taxon contributed up to ca. 5% to the total diatom abundance. All samples containing L. ashworthianium were dominated by small-celled taxa, such as the so-called marine “gomphonemoids” ( Poulinea Majewska, De Stefano & Van de Vijver/ Chelonicola Majewska, De Stefano & Van de Vijver complex) and Nitzschia spp., the former being particularly abundant in the carapace samples. Often, however, several other erect or chain-building araphid taxa, such as Cyclophora spp.,  Hyalosira spp., Licmophora spp., Microtabella sp., and Striatella unipunctata (Lyngbye) C.Agardh were also present. Lucanicum ashworthianum was found neither in the biofilm (twelve samples collected from twelve sea turtles) nor on barnacles (eight samples collected from eight sea turtles) growing on leatherback Dermochelys coriacea Vandelli sea turtles nesting in the same area during the same sampling seasons (Majewska R., unpublished).
Emended description of Lucanicum

Based on the new observations, we propose to emend the generic description of Lucanicum removing the equal labia in the internal opening of rimoportula as a character specific to the genus.

Lucanicum Lobban & Ashworth emend. Majewska, K.Robert & Van de Vijver

Valves araphid with broadly rounded apices, narrow sternum, and apical slit field at each of the poles. Striae uniseriate, nearly parallel throughout the entire valve, consisting of one macroareola, except for the apices. At the apices, striae composed of several smaller areolae. Transapically elongated rimoportula, with either equal or asymmetrical labia, adjacent to the axial area at each of the apices, on the opposite sides of the sternum. Girdle bands open, with two rows of squarish, rectangular (transapically elongated), or irregularly shaped areolae.
Discussion

Since the new taxon exhibits several distinct features, such as parallel striae composed of one macroareola, the open, doubly perforated girdle bands with squarish or rectangular areolae, rimoportula at each apex lying on the opposite sides of the sternum, and distinct apical slit fields at both poles (Lobban and Ashworth 2014a ), a careful morphological analysis allowed its rather unambiguous placement within the genus Lucanicum . Other genera showing similar features include Neosynedra and Cyclophora , based on the presence of the apical slit fields and the structure of the multiple, doubly perforated girdle bands. Both genera however possess cribrate, uniseriate striae as opposed to one macroareola per stria in Lucanicum . Moreover, Cyclophora has pseudosepta on its valves (absent in both Lucanicum and Neosynedra ) excluding the genus as possible host for the new species (Lobban and Ashworth 2014a ).

Lobban and Ashworth ( 2014a ) documented the multiple, ribbon-like plastids in L. concatenatum that differed clearly from the four plate-like plastids observed in Neosynedra , and proposed this feature as a character distinguishing Lucanicum from Neosynedra . Although the number and shape of plastids in L. ashworthianum could not be documented at this time, we believe that, based on the currently available information presented and discussed above, the new taxon is best placed in the genus Lucanicum .

The new taxon differs from the only other currently known Lucanicum species, L. concatenatum , in having considerably smaller cells (110–140 µm vs 20–45 µm, for L. concatenatum and L. ashworthianum , respectively) with clearly rostrate or even sub-capitate apices (absent in L. concatenatum ). The distinct apical slit fields are composed of a smaller number of apically elongated slits (~20 in L. concatenatum vs 10–15 in L. ashworthianum ) that show no horizontal breaks (as opposed to the slit pattern observed in L. concatenatum ). Moreover, except for a few irregular pores adjacent to the apical slit field beyond the apical rimoportula, striae in L. ashworthianum are nearly parallel throughout the entire valve, whereas striae in L. concatenatum become clearly radiate at the valve apices (Lobban and Ashworth 2014a , figs 2C & 2E). Further dissimilarities include differences in the internal structure of the rimoportula opening, which is composed of two equal labia in L. concatenatum but possesses a C-shaped (or crescent-shaped) inner lip and an oval, flap-like outer lip, resembling the structure present in Neosynedra (Williams and Round 1986 ; Lobban and Ashworth 2014a ), in L. ashworthianum .

As previously highlighted, further studies, including observations of live material and DNA analyses, exploring a wider variety of marine substrata and geographic regions are required to better assess the phylogenetic relationship between Lucanicum and Neosynedra , and more satisfactorily resolve the families within Cyclophorales (Lobban and Ashworth 2014a ).

In the current study, an ultrasound bath was used to detach diatoms from the hard-surfaced animal tissue. Although it was suggested that such treatment may significantly increase the number of broken and damaged frustules in the cleaned material and the technique should be used with caution (Majewska et al. 2019 ), similar effects of sonication were not observed during the diatom ultrastructure analysis, as Lucanicum specimens extracted from both non-sonicated carapace biofilm samples and sonicated barnacle samples presented a very similar degree of frustule damage.

Lucanicum ashworthianum is yet another taxon described recently from the biofilm covering sea turtles and their macroepibionts. Interestingly, L. concatenatum has so far been only observed growing on blue corals ( Heliopora coerulea ) and it cannot be excluded that this genus prefers animal or living substrata. However, considering the extremely large number of biotic and abiotic habitats and geographical areas that have not yet been sampled for diatoms, the level of host specificity in Lucanicum , as in many other newly described animal-associated taxa (e.g. Frankovich et al. 2015 ; Majewska et al. 2017a , 2018 , 2019 ), cannot be reliably assessed at this time, and further studies and observations are necessary to provide the more detailed data on epizoic diatoms world-wide.
