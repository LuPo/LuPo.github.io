Ashworth and Bart Van de Vijver Two new epizoic Achnanthes species (Bacillariophyta) living on marine turtles from Costa Rica DOI 10.1515/bot-2016-0114 Received 17 October, 2016; accepted 31 March, 2017; online first 16 May, 2017 Abstract: It has been known for a long time that marine mammals, such as whales and dolphins, host a very specific epizoic community on their skin. Whether or not a similar community exists on the carapaces of sea turtles is less stud - ied. The present paper describes two new epizoic diatoms from the genus Achnanthes sensu stricto , Achnanthes elon - gata and Achnanthes squaliformis , found on the carapaces of nesting olive ridley sea turtles ( Lepidochelys olivacea ) in Ostional Beach on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, based upon detailed scanning electron microscopy and compari- son with the type material of Achnanthes groenlandica var. phinneyi and Achnanthes pseudogroenlandica . The two taxa appear to be closely related on the basis of their morpho - logical features including long, slender valves, absence of terminal orbiculi, large cribrate areolae and absence of typi- cal costae on the internal virgae of both valves. They can, however, be differentiated from each other by the number of areolae per stria, the position of the rapheless sternum and differences in their length/width ratio. Keywords: Achnanthes ; Bacillariophyta; Costa Rica; epizoic diatoms; marine turtles. Introduction Epizoic diatoms have been known for a long time to live either on bird feathers (Holmes and Croll 1984) or the skin of whales and dolphins (Holmes 1985, Denys 1997, Denys and Van Bonn 2001). Several exclusively epizoic genera, such as Epiphalaina R.W. Holmes, Nagasawa et Takano, Bennetella R.W. Holmes and Plumosigma T.  Nemoto were described from the skin of several whale and dolphin species (Nemoto 1956, Holmes 1985, Holmes et  al. 1993). However, epizoic taxa growing on other marine vertebrates have been almost completely overlooked. Recent investigations on epizoic diatoms living on West Indian manatees (Frankovich et al. 2015a), marine turtles (Brady 2010, Frankovich et al. 2015b, 2016, Majewska et al. 2015a, b) and even freshwater turtles (Wetzel et al. 2010, 2012, Pavlov et al. 2016) have resulted in the description of several new species and genera, reveal - ing the presence of an interesting, but still largely unknown and likely underestimated, diatom diversity present on marine and freshwater vertebrates. The monoraphid genus Achnanthes , originally described by Bory in 1822 from material collected by Lyngbye (1819), has long been considered one of the largest genera in the world, mainly based on a very broad generic concept. Over the past decades, a large number of taxa formerly placed in Achnanthes sensu lato were split off and transferred to other, often newly erected genera such as Achnanthidium Kützing, Psammothidium Bukhti- yarova et Round, Pauliella Round et Basson and Plan - othidium Bukhtiyarova et Round, leaving less than 150 recognized taxa in Achnanthes sensu stricto (Toyoda et al. 2005, Tofilovska et  al. 2014).
