Abstract

The current study focuses on four species from the primarily marine diatom genus Craspedostauros that were observed growing attached to numerous sea turtles and sea turtle-associated barnacles from Croatia and South Africa. Three of the examined taxa, C. danayanus sp. nov., C. legouvelloanus sp. nov., and C. macewanii sp. nov., are described based on morphological and, whenever possible, molecular characteristics. The new taxa exhibit characters not previously observed in other members of the genus, such as the presence of more than two rows of cribrate areolae on the girdle bands, shallow perforated septa, and a complete reduction of the stauros. The fourth species, C. alatus , itself recently described from museum sea turtle specimens, is reported for the first time from loggerhead sea turtles rescued in Europe. A 3-gene phylogenetic analysis including DNA sequence data for three sea turtle-associated Craspedostauros species and other marine and epizoic diatom taxa indicated that Craspedostauros is monophyletic and sister to Achnanthes . This study, being based on a large number of samples and animal specimens analyzed and using different preservation and processing methods, provides new insights into the ecology and biogeography of the genus and sheds light on the level of intimacy and permanency in the host–epibiont interaction within the epizoic Craspedostauros species.

Diatom communities inhabiting both the skin and the carapace of marine turtles are composed largely of species not reported from other biotic or abiotic substrata (Frankovich et al.  2015 , 2016 , Majewska et al.  2015a , b , 2017a , b , Robinson et al.  2016 , Azari et al.  2020 , Majewska 2020 , Riaux-Gobin et al.  2020 ). These observations suggest a certain level of host-specific evolutionary adaptations used by sea turtle-associated diatoms. Although intimate relationships between animals and microbes are common and extensively studied, reports of truly epizoic microalgae are generally rare (Ezenwa et al.  2012 , Redford et al.  2012 , Apprill 2017 ). Perhaps due to the fact that ubiquitous photosynthetic organisms, such as diatoms, are not immediately perceived as an essential element of any vertebrate microbiome, these new findings are particularly noteworthy. Based on their high frequency of occurrence and the high relative abundances recorded from various sea turtle species and geographic regions, as well as a lack of records from other types of substrata, several of the newly described sea turtle-associated diatom taxa are currently believed to be strictly epizoic or even sea turtle-specific. While this may be the case, many other diatoms present in samples from sea turtles are likely to be opportunistic species that attached to biofilm in the later stages of its development (Majewska et al.  2015b , 2017b , 2019 , 2020 , Kaleli et al.  2020 , Van de Vijver et al.  2020 ). Although opportunistic taxa often dominate specific epizoic habitats in terms of diversity, they rarely reach high relative abundance, which may suggest they lack some key functional adaptations to the epizoic lifestyle.

The present study focuses on the sea turtle-associated diatom species belonging to the genus Craspedostauros . At present, the genus comprises ten validly described species including one, Craspedostauros alatus , described from museum specimens of sea turtles (Cox 1999 , Sabbe et al.  2003 , Van de Vijver et al.  2012 , Ashworth et al.  2017 , Majewska et al.  2018 ). Craspedostauros is a predominantly marine genus, although C. laevissimus is described as “a widespread endemic species restricted to the Antarctic Continent” and may be of brackish or freshwater origin (Sabbe et al. 2003 , Van de Vijver et al.  2012 ). The typical morphological characters of the genus include cribrate areolae, numerous doubly perforated girdle bands, two fore and aft chloroplasts, and a usually narrow stauros. The latter is reduced or strongly reduced in two species, C. alyoubii and C. paradoxus *. Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that the genus is closely related to Achnanthes and Staurotropis (Ashworth et al.  2017 ). Both taxa, as well as another marine genus Druehlago , which has yet to be characterized using molecular approaches, share several morphological similarities with Craspedostauros (Cox 1999 , Ashworth et al.  2017 ). For example, all the above-mentioned taxa possess valves and girdle bands perforated by cribrate areolae. Craspedostauros  and  Druehlago  share the general frustule morphology, including frustules with central constriction (Ashworth et al.  2017 ), while the fore and aft arrangement of chloroplasts, typical of Craspedostauros , can be observed in several Achnanthes species (Cox 1999 ).

Three previously undescribed species, Craspedostauros danayanus Majewska et Ashworth sp. nov., C. legouvelloanus Majewska et Bosak sp. nov., and C. macewanii Majewska et Ashworth sp. nov., were found in the course of an ongoing survey on sea turtle-associated diatoms and are described in the current paper. Moreover, a population of C. alatus is for the first time reported from Europe. The large number of samples analyzed along with the different preservation and processing techniques applied allowed us to document the ultrastructure of the frustule and, whenever possible, the morphology of the plastids as well as the colony type and attachment mode of the cells. These observations were supplemented by a 3-gene phylogenetic analysis including DNA sequence data for three sea turtle-associated Craspedostauros species and other marine and epizoic diatom taxa.

*The specific epithet in Craspedostauros paradoxa should be changed to “ paradoxus” following the recommendations of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Articles 23.5 & 62; Turland et al.  2018 ).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Material collection and preservation

Diatom samples were collected from captive and wild sea turtles from Croatia and South Africa (Fig.  1 ). All biofilm samples from carapace and skin were taken using single-use sterile toothbrushes following the sampling protocols suitable for diatom culturing and standard morphology-based diatom analysis of Pinou et al. ( 2019 ). In Croatia, single skin and carapace samples were collected from each of 38 loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta , rescued and rehabilitated at the Marine Turtle Rescue Centre in Aquarium Pula between 2016 and 2019, on the day of or shortly after their arrival at the facility. In South Africa, single skin and carapace biofilm samples were collected from each of 78 loggerheads and 20 leatherbacks, Dermochelys coriacea , nesting in Kosi Bay (Indian Ocean) over two nesting seasons, in 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. In addition, 6-mm skin biopsy punches were taken from either front or rear flippers of 30 loggerheads and six leatherbacks and preserved in 4% formaldehyde solution in seawater immediately after collection. Samples of the sea turtle-associated barnacles Chelonibia testudinaria from 100 + loggerheads and Platylepas coriacea from 15 leatherbacks were taken using a plastic paint scraper or a blunt knife over four nesting seasons, from 2015/2016 to 2018/2019. Barnacle samples comprised of more than one specimen were divided into two parts and either frozen (−20°C) or fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution in seawater. Single-specimen barnacle samples were frozen (−20°C). Finally, skin and carapace samples were collected from three loggerheads, three green turtles, Chelonia mydas , and one hawksbill, Eretmochelys imbricata , resident at the uShaka Sea World in Durban on June 28, 2019.

Material collection was performed by, or under close supervision of, qualified field researchers, and the applied techniques and procedures respected ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 2013 ) as well as all applicable national laws.

Type slides and unmounted diatom material used in this study are deposited in the following herbaria: South African National Diatom Collection (SANDC), Croatian National Diatom Collection (HRNDC), and Meise Botanic Garden Herbarium (BR; Index Herbariorum, http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/ ).
Material processing and microscopy

Diatoms were detached from the frozen barnacles using a Transsonic T310 (Elma, Singen, Germany) ultrasound bath as described by Majewska et al. ( 2020 ). Diatom biofilm from the sea turtle skin, carapace, and barnacles was cleaned from organic matter using either a rapid digestion with a mixture of concentrated HNO 3 and H 2 SO 4 (at a ratio of 2:1) following von Stosch’s method (South African and Croatian samples; Hasle and Syvertsen 1997 ) or heated 37% H 2 O 2 with addition of KMnO 4 (Croatian culture strain; van der Werff 1953 ). Cleaned material was mounted on slides using Naphrax (Brunel Microscopes Ltd, Chippenham, UK; Croatian samples) and Pleurax prepared following von Stosch ( 1974 ; South African samples). The slides were examined using a Nikon Eclipse 80i light microscope with Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) and a Nikon DS-Fi1 5MP digital camera (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY; South African samples) as well as a Zeiss Axio Imager A2 with DIC and an Axiocam 305 digital camera (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany; Croatian samples). In addition, fresh material containing living diatoms attached to the sea turtle scutes and skin flakes was stained with blue writing ink (Scheaffer ®) to reveal the colonies of the diatom-associated bacteria.

For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the oxidized suspension was filtered through 1-µm or 1.2-µm Isopore™ (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) or 3-µm Nucleopore (Nucleopore, Pleasanton, CA, USA) polycarbonate membrane filters. Formalin-preserved skin and barnacle samples were dehydrated in an alcohol series (30%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99.9%) followed by critical point-drying in an E3100 Critical Point Dryer (Microscience Division, Watford, UK). Subsequently, the samples were mounted on aluminum stubs with carbon tape and sputter-coated with either gold-palladium using Cressington 108Auto and Cressington 208HR sputter-coaters (Cressington Scientific Instruments Ltd., Watford, UK), palladium using a Precision Etching and Coating System, PECS II (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA), or iridium using Emitech K575X (Emitech Ltd., Ashford, Kent, UK) and Cressington 208 Bench Top sputter-coaters. Diatom specimens were analyzed with JEOL JSM-7800F, JEOL JSM-7001F (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), FEI Quanta Feg 250 (FEI Corporate, Hillsboro, OR, USA), Zeiss Ultra Plus (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and Zeiss SUPRA 40 VP (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY, USA) scanning electron microscopes at 3–10 kV. To determine the relative abundance of the new species, 400 diatom valves were counted and identified in each sample along arbitrarily chosen transects using SEM. The morphology and frustule ultrastructure of the new taxa was compared with those of all known Craspedostauros species worldwide. Taxonomic terminology follows that used in the previous studies focused on this genus (Cox 1999 , Sabbe et al.  2003 , Van de Vijver et al.  2012 , Ashworth et al.  2017 , Majewska et al.  2018 ). The term “rectelevatum” (Van de Vijver et al.  2010 ) is used to describe the internal central thickening formed by partially fused central helictoglossae, which was present in all the novel taxa, either with or without an additional central knob-like structure.
Culturing

Living diatoms from the fresh material (unpreserved samples containing sea turtle biofilm and filtered seawater; Pinou et al.  2019 ) were isolated using a glass pipette with a tip pulled and thinned over a flame into 16 × 100 mm glass culture tubes (South African strains) or plastic culture flasks (Croatian strains) filled with 34 PSU (South African strains) or 38 PSU (Croatian strains) f/2 growth medium (Guillard 1975 ). Strains were lit by natural light from a south-facing window (South African strains) or white fluorescent light with a photoperiod of 12 h (Croatian strain) and maintained at a temperature of 20 – 24°C. The well-grown cultures were divided into two parts, one of which was used for DNA extraction. The remaining part was cleaned with a mixture of 30% H 2 O 2 and 70% HNO 3 and rinsed with distilled water until near-neutral pH was reached in the fluid phase. The Croatian strain (PMFTB0003) was cleaned using saturated KMnO 4 solution and ca. 30% HCl following a protocol modified slightly from Simonsen ( 1974 ). Permanent microscopy slides and SEM stubs were prepared as described above.
DNA preparation and phylogenetic analysis

The cultures were harvested as cell pellets using an Eppendorf 5415C centrifuge (Eppendorf North America, Hauppauge, NY, USA) for 10 min at 8,000 rpm. The QIAGEN DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN Sciences, Valencia, CA, USA) was used for DNA extraction following the manufacturer’s protocol, with the addition of an initial cell disruption by 1.0 mm glass beads in a Mini-Beadbeater (Biospec Products, Inc, Bartlesville, OK, USA) for 45 s. PCR-based DNA amplification and di-deoxy Sanger sequencing of small-subunit nuclear rRNA and the chloroplast-encoded rbcL and psbC markers followed Theriot et al. ( 2010 ).

Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA sequence data was conducted using a three-gene dataset: nuclear-encoded small-subunit (SSU) rRNA, and plastid-encoded rbc L and psb C. Alignment of the SSU sequences, accounting for secondary structure, was carried out using the SSUalign program (Nawrocki et al.  2009 ), with the covariance model based on the 10 diatoms included with the program download, plus 23 additional diatoms from the CRW website (Cannone et al.  2002 ). Post alignment, SSU sequences were concatenated with the chloroplast sequences into a single matrix (Table  S1 in the Supporting Information). Eight separate partitions were created for the data (SSU paired and unpaired sites, plus the first, second, and third codon positions of each of rbc L and psb C). This dataset and partitioning scheme were run under maximum likelihood (ML) using RAxML ver. 8.2.7 (Stamatakis 2014 ) compiled as the pthread-AVX version on an Intel i7-based processor, using the GTR + G model. Twenty-five replicates, each with 500 rapid BS replicates, were run with ML optimizations. Bootstrap support was assessed using the BS replicates from the run with the optimal ML score.
RESULTS

The analyzed biofilm samples contained three previously undescribed species of Craspedostauros as well as C. alatus . These species and populations are described below.

Description

Cells with two fore and aft H-shaped chloroplasts (Fig.  2 , a – d). Frustules extremely delicate and very lightly silicified (Figs.  2 , e–j; 3 , a–e). In girdle view, frustules rectangular, moderately constricted at the center (Fig.  2 , d, f, and j). Valves narrow, linear, very slightly constricted in the valve middle, with bluntly rounded apices (Figs.  2c and 3 , a – e).

Light microscopy (Fig. 3, a–e): Valve dimensions ( n  = 30): length 28 – 61 μm, width 2–2.5 μm, length/width ratio: 14–30.5. In cleaned (acid-digested) material, partially dissolved valve margins barely noticeable (Fig.  3 , a–e, arrows), intact frustules absent. Striae indiscernible (Fig.  3 , a–e). Raphe-sternum thickened, clearly visible (Fig.  3 , a–e). Thickenings at both central and terminal raphe endings (Fig.  3 , a–e).

Scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 3, f–m): Externally: In cleaned material, valve face appearing flat, with very shallow mantle and straight margin (Fig.  3 , f and g). Striae uniseriate, 49 – 51 in 10 μm, parallel, becoming radiate toward the apices, alternate or opposite, composed of up to eight areolae (Fig.  3 , f and g). Areolae largely similar in size, becoming somewhat smaller around the central area, squarish to roundish, externally occluded by cribra (Fig.  3 , f–h). Each cribrum perforated by 2–8 pores (Fig.  3 f). Axial area narrow (Fig.  3 , f and g). Raphe-sternum not raised (Fig.  3 , f–h). Raphe branches straight (Fig.  3 g). Central area large, symmetrical, fusiform (Fig.  3 , g and h). Central raphe endings straight, elongated, slightly expanded (Figs.  3 , g and h). Terminal raphe endings disappearing under somewhat triangular silica flaps extending from the raphe-sternum, giving the impression of unilaterally bent terminal raphe fissures (Fig.  3 , f and g). A large, irregular depression present at the apical flap fold (Fig.  3 , f and g, arrowheads). Shortened striae composed of cribrate areolae radiating around the apices beyond the apical silica flaps (Fig.  3 f). Asymmetrical pore-free area present beyond the terminal raphe endings in the immediate vicinity of the apical flap fold (Fig.  3 f).

Internally : Raphe slit opening laterally onto the more or less uniformly thickened and distinctly raised raphe-sternum (Fig.  3 i). Stauros absent (Fig.  3 , i and j). Central area mirroring the external structure in size and shape (Fig.  3 , i and j). Central raphe endings elongated, very slightly unilaterally bent, terminating onto weakly constricted rectelevatum (Fig.  3 , i and j). Terminal raphe endings positioned somewhat laterally on a large and rounded apical part of the raphe-sternum, terminating in helictoglossae (Fig.  3 , i and l). Asymmetrical thickening extending from the apical part of the raphe-sternum toward the valve margin, corresponding to the external apical silica flaps (Fig.  3 l, arrowheads). Areolae externally occluded with cribra (Fig.  3 , j–l).

Cingulum composed of numerous (14+) open copulae, bearing two rows of typically squarish, roundish, or elongated areolae, ca. 50 – 60 in 10 μm (Fig.  3 , g, l, and m). Areolae occluded externally by cribra (Fig.  3 , l and m).
Taxonomic notes and comparison to other Craspedostauros species

Craspedostauros danayanus is most similar to C. paradoxus , sharing the general valve outline and lacking the stauros. However, C. danayanus differs from the latter in being distinctly smaller (28 – 61 μm vs. 80 – 85 μm) and more slender (2 – 2.5 μm vs. 6.5 – 9 μm), possessing a higher stria density (49 – 51 vs. 36 – 40 in 10 μm), and lacking the lip-like silica flaps (externally) and the central knob (internally) present in C. paradoxus (Table  1 ).

Ecology: Epizoic on carapaces of adult leatherback sea turtles and on leatherback-associated barnacles Platylepas coriacea growing on adult leatherbacks from Kosi Bay (South Africa). Attaching to the animal surface through one end of the valve, motile in culture.

The taxon was found in 12 leatherback skin samples (out of 20 examined) and in all Platylepas coriacea samples examined ( n  = 15) reaching relative abundances of 35% (skin samples) and 79% (barnacle samples). It was found in neither loggerhead nor loggerhead-associated barnacle samples from the same location (Kosi Bay, South Africa). Leatherback skin samples containing Craspedostauros danayanus were dominated by Navicula dermochelycola , Tursiocola neliana , and Poulinea spp. The new taxon was dominant in most of the P. coriacea samples along with Cylindrotheca sp. Both taxa colonized various anatomical parts of the barnacle showing preference for rough surfaces and cavities. The extremely lightly silicified frustules may be an adaptation to the pelagic lifestyle of the host, as the open ocean waters contain significantly lower concentrations of dissolved silica than coastal habitats (Tréguer et al.  1995 ).

Scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 4, g–p)

Externally : Valves somewhat convex, with no clear valve face-mantle junction (Fig.  4 , g–i). Valve margin clearly expanded at the center beyond the stauros (Fig.  4 i). Striae uniseriate, 46 – 49 in 10 μm, parallel throughout the valve center, becoming convergent near the apices, alternate or opposite, composed of up to 13 areolae (Fig.  4 , g, h and n). Areolae similar in size throughout the entire valve, squarish, externally occluded by cribra (Fig.  4 , g–i and n). Each cribrum perforated by 4 pores (Fig.  4 , g–i and n). Axial area very narrow (Fig.  4 , g and h). Raphe-sternum very slightly raised (Fig.  4 , g–i). Raphe branches more or less straight (Fig.  4 g). Central area forming a narrow rectangular fascia (Fig.  4 , g and n). Central raphe endings covered entirely by rimmed lip-like silica flaps extending from one side of the axial area (Fig.  4 , g and n). At the apices, axial area expanding into somewhat triangular silica flaps covering the terminal raphe endings giving the impression of unilaterally bent terminal raphe fissures (Fig.  4 , g–i). An oval or irregular depression present at the apical flap fold (Fig.  4 g, arrows). Shortened stria composed of regular areolae and simple puncta radiating around the apices beyond the terminal raphe endings (Fig.  4 , g–i).

Internally : Raphe slit opening laterally onto the uniformly thick and clearly raised raphe-sternum (Fig.  4 , k and l). Stauros raised, very narrow, broadening abruptly at the mantle expansion and merging with the pore-free area at the valve margin (Fig.  4 , l and o), slightly more expanded on the side corresponding to the external lip-like silica flaps (Fig.  4 l, arrowheads, o and p). Central raphe endings straight or slightly unilaterally bent, terminating onto rectelevatum (Fig.  4 , k, l, o, and p). A blunt cylindrical knob with a small central cavity present between the raphe endings (Fig.  4 , k, l, o, and p). Areolae externally occluded by cribra, appearing sunken, especially close to the stauros (Fig.  4 , o and p). Stauros-adjacent virgae appearing hollow, suggesting a more complex valve structure in that area (Fig.  4 o, arrowheads). Terminal raphe endings positioned somewhat laterally on the raphe-sternum, terminating onto prominent helictoglossae. At the apices, raphe-sternum expanded laterally toward the valve margin, merged with pore-free area corresponding to the external apical silica flaps (Fig.  4 , l and m).

Cingulum composed of numerous (12+) open copulae, bearing two rows of typically squarish or elongated areolae, ca. 50 – 60 in 10 μm (Fig.  4 , h–k). Areolae occluded externally by cribra with 4 – 12 pores per cribrum (Fig.  4 , h–k). Valvocopula curved, distinctly narrower, and pore-free beside the stauros (Fig.  4 i, arrowheads). An internal ridge (septum) perforated by puncta present in each copula except for valvocopula (Fig.  4 , i–k, arrowheads).
Adriatic population (Fig. 5, a–g)

Specimens resembling Craspedostauros leguovelloanus were found on the carapace of six loggerhead sea turtles sampled on the Croatian coast of the Adriatic Sea. Most of the morphological features observed in the Adriatic population (Fig.  5 , a–g) agreed well with those found in C. legouvelloanus . The cells possessed two fore and aft H-shaped chloroplasts (Fig.  5 a, arrows) as observed previously in other Craspedostauros species (Cox 1999 , Ashworth et al.  2017 , Majewska et al.  2018 ). The specimens were slightly longer (23 – 39 μm) and wider (3.5 – 6 μm, length/width ratio: 5.2 – 7.8, n  = 25) than those from the South African population, and their stria density was lower (40 – 44 in 10 μm vs. 46 – 49 in 10 μm; Table  1 ). In general, the frustules showed a relatively high degree of irregularity in the areolae structure and the size and shape of stauros, axial area, and facia (Fig.  5 , b – e).

Taxonomic notes and comparison to other Craspedostauros species

Currently, Craspedostauros legouvelloanus is the only known Craspedostauros species with septate girdle bands, although this may be an artifact of incomplete morphological descriptions that rarely mention or present the internal girdle band structure. Valves of C. legouvelloanus differ from those of all known stauros-bearing Craspedostauros species in possessing a very high stria density (above 40 in 10 μm). Although a similarly high or higher stria density was observed in C. alyoubii (~40 in 10 μm) and C. danayanus (49 – 51 in 10 μm), the two species are larger (83 – 105 μm and 28 – 61 μm) than C. legouvelloanus (18 – 34 [39] μm) and their general morphology differs considerably from that of the current taxon in, for example, possessing a reduced or strongly reduced stauros (Table  1 ). Several of the characters of C. legouvelloanus , such as largely uniform valve areolae with four pores per cribrum and internal central knob, agree with the description of C. australis (Cox 1999 ). However, the new species can be easily distinguished from the latter by its clearly centrally expanded valve margin and well-developed lip-like silica flaps externally covering the central raphe endings, features that are absent in C. australis (Table  1 ).

The specimens from the Adriatic population of Craspedostauros legouvelloanus exhibited numerous irregularities in the shape and size of taxonomically important characters such as areolae, striae, stauros, and central area. However, overall, they did not differ significantly from the type population. High morphological plasticity and polymorphy in diatoms have been reported from both epizoic and non-epizoic habitats (Cox 2011 , De Martino et al.  2011 , Riaux-Gobin et al.  2014 , 2017 , Urbánková et al.  2016 , Edlund and Burge 2019 ), and it is conceivable that the morphological differences observed between the two populations could be induced by environmental triggers, such as differences in salinity or nutrient concentrations (Schultz 1971 , Czarnecki 1994 , De Martino et al.  2011 , Cox 2014 ). Unfortunately, the Croatian strain PMFTB0003 (Fig.  5 , a, c, e, and f) isolated from sample TB13 did not survive and its DNA could not be obtained at the time of this study. Therefore, in the light of the current lack of any additional information about the phylogenetic relationships between the two populations, they should be considered conspecific until otherwise proven.
Ecology

Epizoic on carapaces and skin of adult loggerhead sea turtles and on loggerhead-associated barnacles Chelonibia testudinaria growing on adult loggerheads from Kosi Bay (South Africa) and the Adriatic Sea (Croatia). Attaching to the animal surface through one end of the valve, motile in culture.

Although the taxon was present in numerous samples, its relative abundance rarely exceeded 4% of the total diatom number. Samples with Craspedostauros legouvelloanus from both locations were each dominated by Poulinea spp., Berkeleya spp., Halamphora spp., and Nitzschia spp., with addition of Achnanthes elongata , Cyclophora tenuis , Proschkinia spp., Navicula spp., Licmophora spp., and Haslea spp.

Taxonomic notes and comparison to other Craspedostauros species

The morphological character pattern in Craspedostauros macewanii is most similar to C. australis and C .  capensis . The three species share several features such as the presence of a bow tie-shaped fascia, rudimentary lip-like silica flaps extending from the raphe-sternum and partially covering the external central raphe endings, valve margin straight at the center, and internally, a single knob at the central nodule (Table  1 ). Moreover, valve dimensions of C. macewanii (26–51 μm long, 4.5–5.5 μm wide) overlap with those reported for C. australis (35–78 μm long, 4–6 μm wide) and C. capensis (25–35 μm long, 4.5–5.5 μm wide). In C. macewanii , however, the stria density (28–31 in 10 μm) is significantly higher than in C. capensis (~19 in 10 μm) and lower than in C. australis (35 in 10 μm). In addition, C. macewanii can be distinguished from both C. australis and C. capensis by the presence of a distinct valve face-mantle junction running as a narrow, though clearly visible, pore-free ridge from apex to apex. Craspedostauros macewanii differs further from C. capensis in possessing areolae of a similar size throughout the entire valve (variable in C. capensis ), and from C. australis in having convergent stria at the apices (parallel in C. australis ) and extended apical hyaline zone (Cox 1999 ). The new taxon is also the only Craspedostauros species with girdle bands perforated by up to five rows of squarish areolae instead of the two rows of usually transapically elongated areolae observed in other species. This, however, may again be an artifact of the lack of detailed information regarding the girdle structure and ornamentation in several other Craspedostauros species (Cox 1999 ).
Ecology

Epizoic on skin and carapaces of captive loggerheads and green turtles. Attaching to the animal surface through one end of the valve, motile in culture.

The taxon was found on two captive loggerheads (a juvenile named “Bubbles” and an adult female named “DJ”) and two captive green turtles (a subadult named “Calypso” and an adult male named “Napoleon”) each time reaching relative abundance of 0.5%–1%. All carapace samples containing C. macewanii were dominated by the so-called “marine gomphonemoids”: Poulinea spp. and Chelonicola spp., accompanied by Amphora spp., Nitzschia spp., Achnanthes elongata, and A. squaliformis , whereas the most abundant taxa in the four skin samples were Tursiocola spp., Medlinella sp., and the two previously mentioned Achnanthes species.
Craspedostauros alatus Majewska & Ashworth (Fig. 7)

Craspedostauros alatus was found on the carapaces of several loggerhead sea turtles sampled at the Marine Turtle Rescue Centre in Pula, Croatia. The taxon co-occurred with C. legouvelloanus . As in the case of the latter, relative abundance of C. alatus was low (ca. 1–3% of the total diatom number). The observed morphological features of the Adriatic population agreed with the original description of the species (Majewska et al. 2018 ; Fig.  7 , Table  1 ). The examined specimens were 26 – 34 μm long and 3 – 5 μm wide (length/width ratio: 6.3 – 8.8), with stria density 24 – 27 in 10 μm ( n  = 20), and possessed all species-specific features, including a very distinct valve face-mantle junction and deep mantle (Fig.  7 f, arrows, g–i), wing-like silica flaps at the apices (Fig.  7h ), and rectelevatum with central cavity (Fig.  7 , k and l).

DNA-based phylogeny

The genus Craspedostauros is monophyletic based on DNA sequence data generated from cultured material to date (Fig.  8 ), though not with strong bootstrap support (bs < 50%). Regarding the taxa described here, Craspedostauros macewanii is sister to the reminder of the clade (except C. amphoroides ) with high support (bs = 96%), while C. danayanus is sister to C. alyoubii and C. paradoxus (bs = 71%).

Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogram based on the 3-gene dataset (nuclear-encoded ribosomal SSU, chloroplast-encoded rbcL, psbC markers). For clarity, only the clade of raphid diatoms containing Staurotropis , Craspedostauros , and Achnanthes is presented in the figure. The ML tree presenting the complete taxon sampling can be viewed in Figure S1.

Consistent with other molecular phylogenetic studies which include the genus (Ashworth et al. 2017 ), the position of the Craspedostauros clade can be found in a poorly supported (bs < 50%) assemblage containing the Staurotropis clade and a clade of marine Achnanthes species. This assemblage, in turn, forms a clade with the Bacillariales (Fig.  S1 in the Supporting Informations), though the relationship between the Staurotropis + Achnanthes + Craspedostauros clade and the three Bacillariales clades is poorly resolved. For taxa, strain voucher ID and GenBank accession numbers for strains used in the analysis see Table  S1 .
Discussion

The three new species described in the current study share most of the morphological characters typical of the genus Craspedostauros , such as squarish or rectangular areolae occluded by cribra on the valve and girdle bands, multiple copulae with at least two rows of perforations, and two fore and aft chloroplasts. Their linear or linear-lanceolate valve outline and the central constriction of the cell seen in girdle view resemble previously described species. Two of the new species, C. macewanii and C. legouvelloanus , present features not previously observed in any other member of the genus. The former possesses more than two rows of cribrate areolae on the girdle bands, while the latter shows shallow perforated septa. The leatherback-associated C. danayanus , in turn, presents a complete reduction of the stauros being the second, after C. paradoxus , member of the genus lacking this character.

It is interesting to note that as the number of character states, such as the reduction/loss of the stauros ( Craspedostauros paradoxus and C. danayanus ) or addition of septate copulae (C.  legouvelloanus ), within Craspedostauros changes, the molecular data remain constant in their support (however tenuous) of monophyly for the genus. Cox ( 1999 ) ascribed the constricted girdle view to the presence of the stauros. However, the frustules of the two species lacking the latter still show the central constriction, which may indicate that the lack of stauros is a secondary loss. One of the morphological features of the genus which has been maintained, regardless of newly described diversity, is the cribrate areolar covering. While the degree of cribrum poration might change among species, the overall gestalt ultrastructure remains unchanged. This cribrum ultrastructure is also seen in Staurotropis and the Achnanthes species, which are typically found (again, somewhat tenuously) sister to the Craspedostauros clade in molecular phylogenies. While there are general morphological similarities between the three genera, such as the stauros (though missing in some species of Craspedostauros and Achnanthes ) and the fore and aft H-shaped or plate-like chloroplasts (missing in Staurotropis and some species of Achnanthes ), the cribrate areolae ultrastructure remains constant. In this context, the phylogenetic position of the genus Druehlago , which shares the same cribrum ultrastructure and the same chloroplast morphology as Staurotropis and Achnanthes longipes , but thus far lacks a stauros-bearing taxon, is all the more intriguing (Ashworth et al. 2017 ).

Microscopical analyses of the fresh and critical point-dried sea turtle skin pieces and barnacles revealed the mode of attachment and growth form of Craspedostauros danayanus that attaches to the animal substratum through one pole of the cell. A similar mode of attachment to the natural substratum was observed in several members of the genus (R. Majewska, pers. obs.) suggesting that these taxa can either develop as firmly attached, sessile colonies, or remain motile in less favorable conditions (e.g., in culture tubes).

In the course of the ongoing surveys on sea turtle-associated diatoms, a recently described taxon, Craspedostauros alatus , was observed growing on the carapaces of several loggerhead sea turtles rescued in Croatia. Craspedostauros alatus was originally described from museum specimens of juvenile Kemp’s ridleys ( Lepidochelys kempii ) and a juvenile green turtle found cold-stunned and beyond recovery on a New York (USA) beach during various seasons between 2012 and 2014 (Majewska et al. 2018 ). Although the relative abundance of C. alatus did not exceed 5.5% (current study, Majewska et al. 2018 ), observations of this taxon on a sea turtle from the Adriatic Sea may indicate that a) C. alatus is not an uncommon element of the sea turtle diatom flora, and b) being associated with highly migratory animals such as sea turtles its geographical range is likely linked to that of its hosts.

A similar conclusion can be drawn based on the records of Craspedostauros legouvelloanus . The species occurred on several of the Adriatic loggerheads as well as on dozens of loggerheads and their associated barnacles sampled on the eastern coast of South Africa. Even though the diatom was found in two different ocean basins, it cannot be excluded that the sea turtles acted as vectors that facilitated its dispersal among the various seas and oceans. There is strong observational and molecular evidence that the Indian Ocean loggerheads interact and mate with the Atlantic members of the species (Bowen et al.  1994 , Bowen and Karl 2007 , Le Gouvello et al.  2020 ). Thus, it is conceivable that any diatom able to endure the changing conditions during the migrations of their hosts and survive in competition with native flora would inoculate all appropriate and available media and substrata encountered. With the exception of C. danayanus , the sea turtle-associated Craspedostauros species, although common on sea turtles, were never among the dominant taxa, and it is still unclear whether the animal body surface is their preferred or an alternative habitat as yet they have not been recorded from non-sea turtle substrata. It is possible that the occurrence of these species in the sea turtle biofilm samples is linked to the presence of some other sea turtle epibionts (e.g., barnacles, sponges, and bryozoans).

Craspedostauros danayanus , in turn, dominated most of the leatherback skin and barnacle samples that were analyzed, and it is likely that this taxon is highly adapted to the conditions provided by the smooth body of the largest of the sea turtles. Being associated with both the skin and the leatherback-specific barnacle species, Platylepas coriacea , its relationship with the host may be obligatory. Leatherbacks, contrary to other extant sea turtles, show a fully oceanic developmental pattern spending most of their lives in highly homogenous open-water environments devoid of refugia (Bolten 2003 ). They are unique among modern reptiles in being endothermal (Frair et al.  1972 ). This ability allows them to survive in both tropical and near-freezing waters (James et al.  2006 ). They are also significantly faster swimmers and deeper divers than other sea turtles (Eckert 2002 , Doyle et al.  2008 ). Therefore, microhabitats provided by these animals, and thus diatom communities contributing to their microbiomes, would differ substantially from those present on other sea turtles. Under such unique conditions, far from the diverse, species-rich shallow-water ecosystems, specific eco-physiological adaptations may be required to survive, and fewer diatom species would manage to thrive on the demanding substratum. An analogous phenomenon is reported from marine cetaceans that seem to be colonized by only a few, highly specialized, diatom taxa (e.g., Nemoto 1956 , Holmes et al.  1993 , Ferrario et al.  2018 ). Future studies will likely reveal a more complete picture of the diversity and biogeography of sea turtle-associated Craspedostauros and other diatom taxa.
