Algal feedstocks are promising candidate replacements as a ‘drop-in’ fuel. Here, we focus on a specific algal taxon, diatoms, to become the fossil fuel of the future. We summarize past attempts to obtain suitable diatom strains, propose future directions for their genetic manipulation, and offer biotechnological pathways to improve yield. We calculate that the yields obtained by using diatoms as a production platform are theoretically sufficient to satisfy the total oil consumption of the {US}, using between 3 and 5\% of its land area.},

	abstract = {Patterns of species richness are commonly linked to life history strategies. In diatoms, an exceptionally diverse lineage of photosynthetic heterokonts important for global photosynthesis and burial of atmospheric carbon, lineages with different locomotory and reproductive traits differ dramatically in species richness, but any potential association between life history strategy and diversification has not been tested in a phylogenetic framework. We constructed a time-calibrated, 11-gene, 1151-taxon phylogeny of diatoms - the most inclusive diatom species tree to date. We used this phylogeny, together with a comprehensive inventory of first-last occurrences of Cenozoic fossil diatoms, to estimate ranges of expected species richness, diversification and its variation through time and across lineages. Diversification rates varied with life history traits. Although anisogamous lineages diversified faster than oogamous ones, this increase was restricted to a nested clade with active motility in the vegetative cells. We propose that the evolution of motility in vegetative cells, following an earlier transition from oogamy to anisogamy, facilitated outcrossing and improved utilization of habitat complexity, ultimately leading to enhanced opportunity for adaptive divergence across a variety of novel habitats. Together, these contributed to a species radiation that gave rise to the majority of present-day diatom diversity.},

	abstract = {Diatoms are a diverse group of mainly photosynthetic algae, responsible for 20\% of worldwide oxygen production, which can rapidly respond to favorable conditions and often outcompete other phytoplankton. We investigated the contribution of horizontal gene transfer ({HGT}) to its ecological success. A large-scale phylogeny-based prokaryotic {HGT} detection procedure across nine sequenced diatoms showed that 3–5\% of their proteome has a horizontal origin and a large influx occurred at the ancestor of diatoms. More than 90\% of {HGT} genes are expressed, and species-specific {HGT} genes in Phaeodactylum tricornutum undergo strong purifying selection. Genes derived from {HGT} are implicated in several processes including environmental sensing and expand the metabolic toolbox. Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is an essential cofactor for roughly half of the diatoms and is only produced by bacteria. Five consecutive genes involved in the final synthesis of the cobalamin biosynthetic pathway, which could function as scavenging and repair genes, were detected as {HGT}. The full suite of these genes was detected in the cold-adapted diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus. This might give diatoms originating from the Southern Ocean, a region typically depleted in cobalamin, a competitive advantage. Overall, we show that {HGT} is a prevalent mechanism that is actively used in diatoms to expand its adaptive capabilities.},

	abstract = {While the oceans cover more than 70\% of the Earth’s surface, marine derived microbial natural products have been largely unexplored. The marine environment is a habitat for many unique microorganisms, which produce biologically active compounds (“bioactives”) to adapt to particular environmental conditions. For example, marine surface associated microorganisms have proven to be a rich source for novel bioactives because of the necessity to evolve allelochemicals capable of protecting the producer from the fierce competition that exists between microorganisms on the surfaces of marine eukaryotes. Chemically driven interactions are also important for the establishment of cross-relationships between microbes and their eukaryotic hosts, in which organisms producing antimicrobial compounds (“antimicrobials”), may protect the host surface against over colonisation in return for a nutrient rich environment. As is the case for bioactive discovery in general, progress in the detection and characterization of marine microbial bioactives has been limited by a number of obstacles, such as unsuitable culture conditions, laborious purification processes, and a lack of de-replication. However many of these limitations are now being overcome due to improved microbial cultivation techniques, microbial (meta-) genomic analysis and novel sensitive analytical tools for structural elucidation. Here we discuss how these technical advances, together with a better understanding of microbial and chemical ecology, will inevitably translate into an increase in the discovery and development of novel drugs from marine microbial sources in the future.},

	abstract = {Diatoms are the most diverse lineage of algae and at the base of most aquatic food webs, but only 11 of their mitochondrial genomes have been described. Herein, we present the mitochondrial genomes of six diatom species, including: Melosira undulata, Nitzschia alba, Surirella sp., Entomoneis sp., Halamphora coffeaeformis, and Halamphora calidilacuna. Comparison of these six genomes to the 11 currently published diatom mitochondrial genomes revealed a novel ubiquitous feature block consisting of {tatC}-orf157-rps11. The presence of intronic retrotransposable elements in the barcoding region of cox1 in the Halamphora genomes may explain historic difficulty (especially {PCR}) with cox1 as a universal barcode for diatoms. Our analysis suggests that high rates of variability in number and position of introns, in many commonly used coding sequences, prevent these from being universally viable as barcodes for diatoms. Therefore, we suggest researchers examine the chloroplast and/or nuclear genomes for universal barcoding markers.},

	abstract = {The year 2014 saw more than a thousand new mitochondrial genome sequences deposited in GenBank — an almost 15\% increase from the previous year. Hundreds of peer-reviewed articles accompanied these genomes, making mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) the most sequenced and reported type of eukaryotic chromosome. These {mtDNA} data have advanced a wide range of scientific fields, from forensics to anthropology to medicine to molecular evolution. But for many biological lineages, {mtDNAs} are so well sampled that newly published genomes are arguably no longer contributing significantly to the progression of science, and in some cases they are tying up valuable resources, particularly journal editors and referees. Is it time to acknowledge that as a research community we have published enough mitochondrial genome papers? Here, I address this question, exploring the history, milestones and impacts of mitochondrial genomics, the benefits and drawbacks of continuing to publish {mtDNAs} at a high rate and what the future may hold for such an important and popular genetic marker. I highlight groups for which {mtDNAs} are still poorly sampled, thus meriting further investigation, and recommend that more energy be spent characterizing aspects of mitochondrial genomes apart from the {DNA} sequence, such as their chromosomal and transcriptional architectures. Ultimately, one should be mindful before writing a mitochondrial genome paper. Consider perhaps sending the sequence directly to {GenBank} instead, and be sure to annotate it correctly before submission.},
