	abstract = {Despite recent advances in polar marine biology and related fields, many aspects of the ecological interactions that are crucial for the functioning of Antarctic shallow water habitats remain poorly understood. Although epiphytic diatoms play an essential role in the Antarctic marine food web, basic information regarding their ecology, biodiversity and biogeography is largely unavailable. Here, we synthesise studies on Ross Sea epiphytic diatoms collected during 11 summer Antarctic expeditions between the years 1989/90 and 2011/12, presenting a full list of diatom taxa associated with three macroalgal species (Iridaea cordata, Phyllophora antarctica, and Plocamium cartilagineum) and their epiphytic sessile fauna. Diatom communities found during the three summer months at various depths and sampling stations differed significantly in terms of species composition, growth form structure and abundances. Densities ranged from 21 to {\textgreater}8000 cells mm-2, and were significantly higher on the surface of epiphytic micro-fauna than on any of the macroalgal species examined. Generally, host organisms characterized by higher morphological heterogeneity (sessile microfauna, ramified Plocamium) supported richer diatom communities than those with more uniform surfaces (Iridaea). Differences between epiphytic communities associated with different macroalgae were reflected better in species composition than in growth form structure. The latter changed significantly with season, which was related strongly to the changing ice conditions. A general trend towards an increasing number of erect forms in deeper waters and tube-dwelling diatoms in the shallowest sites (2–5 m) was also observed. This study explores further important and largely previously unknown aspects of relationships and interactions between Antarctic epiphytic diatoms and their micro- and macro-environments.},

	abstract = {Although the sea turtles have long been familiar and even iconic to marine biologists, many aspects of their ecology remain unaddressed. The present study is the first of the epizoic diatom community covering the olive ridley turtle’s (Lepidochelys olivacea) carapace and the first describing diatoms living on sea turtles in general, with the primary objective of providing detailed information on turtle epibiotic associations. Samples of turtle carapace including the associated diatom biofilm and epizoic macro-fauna were collected from Ostional beach (9° 59´ 23.7´´ N 85° 41´ 52.6´´ W), Costa Rica, during the arribada event in October 2013. A complex diatom community was present in every sample. In total, 11 macro-faunal and 21 diatom taxa were recorded. Amongst diatoms, the most numerous were erect (Achnanthes spp., Tripterion spp.) and motile (Haslea sp., Navicula spp., Nitzschia spp., Proschkinia sp.) forms, followed by adnate Amphora spp., while the most common macro-faunal species was Stomatolepas elegans (Cirripedia). Diatom densities ranged from 8179 ± 750 to 27685 ± 4885 cells mm-2. Epizoic microalgae were either partly immersed or entirely encapsulated within an exopolymeric coat. The relatively low diatom species number, stable species composition and low inter-sample dissimilarities (14.4\% on average) may indicate a mutualistic relationship between the epibiont and the basibiont. Dispersal of sea turtle diatoms is probably highly restricted and similar studies will help to understand both diatom diversity, evolution and biogeography, and sea turtle ecology and foraging strategies.},

Less known however is the presence of a similar community on the carapaces of sea turtles. The present study is the first describing new taxa inhabiting sea turtle carapaces. Samples, collected from nesting olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) on Ostional Beach (Costa Rica), were studied using light and scanning electron microscopy. Two unknown small-celled gomphonemoid taxa were analysed in more detail and are described as two new genera, closely related to other gomphonemoid genera with septate girdle bands, such as Tripterion, Cuneolus and Gomphoseptatum. Chelonicola Majewska, De Stefano \& Van de Vijver gen. nov. has a flat valve face, uniseriate striae composed of more than three areolae, simple external raphe endings, internally a siliceous flap over the proximal raphe endings and lives on mucilaginous stalks. Poulinea Majewska, De Stefano \& Van de Vijver gen. nov. has at least one concave valve, uniseriate striae composed of only two elongated areolae, external distal raphe endings covered by thickened siliceous flaps and lives attached to the substrate by a mucilaginous pad. Chelonicola costaricensis Majewska, De Stefano \& Van de Vijver sp. nov. and Poulinea lepidochelicola Majewska, De Stefano \& Van de Vijver sp. nov. can be separated based on stria structure, girdle structure composed of more than 10 copulae, raphe structure and general valve outline. A cladistics analysis of putative members of the Rhoicospheniaceae indicates that the family is polyphyletic. Chelonicola and Poulinea are sister taxa, and form a monophyletic group with Cuneolus and Tripterion, but are not closely related to Rhoicosphenia, or other genera previously assigned to this family. Features used to help diagnose the family such as symmetry and presence of septa and pseudosepta are homoplastic across the raphid diatom tree of life.},

Here, we present a first growth form analysis of diatoms associated with rhodophyte hosts from Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea, Antarctica. We performed this study to gather baseline information on the species composition of epiphytic diatom communities, determine the influence of some environmental variables on the diatom distribution patterns, and assess the caveats that must be taken into account in terms of sampling design. Macroalgal material was collected during the Italian Antarctic expeditions between 1990 and 2004. Epiphytic diatoms were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy. In terms of growth forms, there were no significant differences between the diatom communities on the different macroalgal host species. Motile (mainly small-celled Naviculaperminuta and other Navicula spp.) and adnate (Cocconeis spp.) diatoms dominated the community throughout the study period. Many of the macroalgal blades examined were also covered by epiphytic animals (calcareous bryozoans, hydroids) over most of their surface, with a significant effect on the associated diatom community structure. Our findings suggest that the bio-physicochemical characteristics of each sampling site affected the epiphytic diatom communities more than the substrate type provided by the macroalgal host or the sampling depth.},

The diatom flora growing on hard surfaces near the river banks such as sand, muddy sand, rocks, macroscopic green algae and/or vascular aquatic plants was recorded. All diatom taxa collected were distinguished based on their morphological features using light ({LM}) and scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}). A total of 187 species belonging to 61 genera were identified. A canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the diatom assemblages were definitely associated with salinity as well as nutrient concentrations and substratum type. During the study, malformations of diatom valves were observed in 48\% of the microphytobenthos samples. Abnormal outline morphology and ornamentation deformities in several individuals of nine different species were recorded, which were mainly in epilithic and epiphytic communities collected from spring to autumn.},

Diatom observations and counts were carried out using scanning electron microscopy. Techniques involving critical point drying enabled observations of diatoms and other microepibionts still attached to sea turtle carapace and revealed specific aspects of the epizoic community structure. Species-poor, well-developed diatom communities were found on all examined sea turtles. Significant differences between the two host sea turtle populations were observed in terms of diatom abundance and their community structure (including growth form structure). A total of 12 and 22 diatom taxa were found from sea turtles in Iran and Costa Rica, respectively, and eight of these species belonging to Amphora, Chelonicola, Cocconeis, Navicula, Nitzschia and Poulinea genera were observed in samples from both locations. Potential mechanisms of diatom dispersal and the influence of the external environment, sea turtle behaviour, its life stage, and foraging and breeding habitats, as well as epibiotic bacterial flora on epizoic communities, are discussed.},

Despite this distinct morphology, frustules of Proschkinia are typically weakly silicified and often overlooked when cleaned diatom material is analysed. The current paper describes six new species of Proschkinia: P. browderiana sp. nov., P. lacrimula sp. nov., P. maluszekiana sp. nov., P. sulcata sp. nov., P. torquata sp. nov. and P. vergostriata sp. nov., found in numerous samples of marine organisms, such as sea turtles (including sea turtle museum specimens), sea turtle-associated barnacles and seagrass from across the three oceans. Some of the newly described taxa were found on multiple individuals belonging to different sea turtle species, whereas others were in samples collected from different continents. Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that examined Proschkinia strains formed a monophyletic clade, sister to Fistulifera.},

In every studied case, adnate Cocconeis spp. cells dominated the community. Among 32 Cocconeis species and varieties found, recently described C. neothumensis var. marina and C. scutellum var. posidoniae were almost always the most numerous. The structure of Cocconeis assemblages changed across the various geographic regions both in terms of the species’ presence–absence and their relative abundance. In general, the most abundant species appeared to be broadly distributed, while less abundant species had a more distinct biogeographic pattern.

Here we describe our findings of a study on epiphytic diatoms from Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica) based on material collected during the summer campaigns spanning from 1990–2004. Observations of diatoms associated with three rhodophyte species (Iridaea cordata (Turner) Bory, Phyllophora antarctica Gepp \& Gepp, and Plocamium cartilagineum (L.) Dixon) were carried out with the use of a scanning electron microscope. A total of 73 diatom taxa (32 genera) were distinguished, of which 20 taxa exceeded 3\% of total abundance. Cocconeis fasciolata (Ehrenberg) Brown, Navicula perminuta Grunow, and Fragilariopsis nana (Steemann Nielsen) Paasche appeared in every sample. The analysis of similarities ({ANOSIM}) test as well as non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis indicated the nature of host organism as a major factor influencing associated diatom community structure, whereas depth, site, and time of sampling seemed to be less important. The epizooic communities associated with sessile fauna epiphytic on macroalgae differed significantly from those associated with macroalgal surface. A pronounced difference between the communities epiphytic on various host macroalgae species was also observed, although most of the dissimilarities occurred between diatom taxa of the same growth form.},

	abstract = {Secretome of primary cultures is an accessible source of biological markers compared to more complex and less decipherable mixtures such as serum or plasma. The protonation state ({PS}) of secretome reflects the metabolism of cells and can be used for cancer early detection. Here, we demonstrate a superhydrophobic organic electrochemical device that measures {PS} in a drop of secretome derived from liquid biopsies. Using data from the sensor and principal component analysis ({PCA}), we developed algorithms able to efficiently discriminate tumour patients from non-tumour patients. We then validated the results using mass spectrometry and biochemical analysis of samples. For the 36 patients across three independent cohorts, the method identified tumour patients with high sensitivity and identification as high as 100\% (no false positives) with declared subjects at-risk, for sporadic cancer onset, by intermediate values of {PS}. This assay could impact on cancer risk management, individual’s diagnosis and/or help clarify risk in healthy populations.},

	abstract = {Significant advances in the understanding of the molecular determinants of fibrillogenesis can be expected from comparative studies of the aggregation propensities of proteins with highly homologous structures but different folding pathways. Here, we fully characterize, by means of stopped-flow, T-jump, {CD} and {DSC} experiments, the unfolding mechanisms of three highly homologous proteins, zinc binding Ros87 and Ml153–149 and zinc-lacking Ml452–151. The results indicate that the three proteins significantly differ in terms of stability and (un)folding mechanisms. Particularly, Ros87 and Ml153–149 appear to be much more stable to guanidine denaturation and are characterized by folding mechanisms including the presence of an intermediate. On the other hand, metal lacking Ml452–151 folds according to a classic two-state model. Successively, we have monitored the capabilities of Ros87, Ml452–151 and Ml153–149 to form amyloid fibrils under native conditions. Particularly, we show, by {CD}, fluorescence, {DLS}, {TEM} and {SEM} experiments, that after 168 hours, amyloid formation of Ros87 has started, while Ml153–149 has formed only amorphous aggregates and Ml452–151 is still monomeric in solution. This study shows how metal binding can influence protein folding pathways and thereby control conformational accessibility to aggregation-prone states, which in turn changes aggregation kinetics, shedding light on the role of metal ions in the development of protein deposition diseases.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of diatoms, one of the most important Antarctic primary producers, is based mostly on investigations of plankton, sea-ice, and sediment samples. Herein, we contribute to the limited research devoted to benthic Antarctic diatoms by presenting a study on epiphytic diatom communities sampled in two remote Antarctic regions: Admiralty Bay (maritime Antarctica, Antarctic Peninsula) and Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea). Recent studies have demonstrated that the most critical factor for the local epiphytic diatom communities was the nature of the substrate. In order to eliminate this factor so we could evaluate other potential controls, we sampled epiphytic diatoms from only one substrate that is common to both regions: the macroalgae Plocamium cartilagineum (L.) Dixon. Thalli of P. cartilagineum and their associated microalgal community was collected in January 2011 (Admiralty Bay) and 2012 (Terra Nova Bay) from a water depth of 5–25 m. Dehydrated macroalgal pieces were placed on stubs and sputter-coated, which allowed observation of diatoms attached to the substrate in their original position using scanning electron microscopy. A total of 72 taxa were observed, of which 31 taxa were common to both regions. Cell abundance and diatom growth form dominance were significantly different in Admiralty Bay and Terra Nova Bay samples. Total diatom abundance was higher in Admiralty Bay samples, dominated by adnate diatoms (Cocconeis spp.), but the number of taxa found as well as the values of ecological indices were higher for samples from the Ross Sea, where motile forms were dominant (Navicula spp.). Our results suggest that Antarctic shallow-water benthic habitats may present a high degree of microniche heterogeneity and highlight the need of fine-scale analyses in microbial studies. We also suggest grazers as a factor that contributes greatly to the observed differences.},

	abstract = {Several populations of a new Craspedostauros species were observed on museum specimens of juvenile green turtle and Kemp’s ridleys collected from Long Island Beach, New York, {USA}. The new taxon, Craspedostauros alatus Majewska \& Ashworth sp. nov., exhibits a distinctive set of morphological features typical of the genus, including cribrate areolae, a stauros narrower than the fascia, multiple doubly perforated girdle bands, and two fore and aft chloroplasts, but clearly differs from all known Craspedostauros species in possessing partially fused proximal helictoglossae forming an internal thickening with a shallow central cavity, distinctive external wing-like silica flaps near the apices, and a combination of valve dimensions and stria density not observed in other taxa. The same taxon was identified in the {NCMA} culture collection (strain {CCMP}120), isolated in 1967 from a sample collected from the equatorial upwelling zone in the Pacific Ocean. Nine samples from three sea turtle species were collected from the same location (Long Island Beach). Statistical analyses suggested that the epizoic diatom flora composition was not affected by the collection season but differed among sea turtle species. The most significant difference was observed between the samples with and without C. alatus. Samples with C. alatus were always dominated by Achnanthes elongata and Berkeleya cf. rutilans, while those lacking the new taxon were characterized by remarkably higher contributions of epizoic Poulinea species. This observation suggests that the microhabitat provided by each sea turtle differs among specimens, which may be related to the different stages of biofilm development on the host sea turtle. Additionally, the value of zoological museum collections for epizoic diatom surveys is briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Tropical estuaries often have a low buffering capacity and may experience acidification, both naturally through microbial degradation and run-off from acid sulphate soils ({ASS}), or from various anthropogenic sources. Here, we describe phytoplankton communities from the turbid, acidified, and eutrophic Sungai Brunei and Brunei Bay estuarine system. Four sampling stations were selected, representing the full spectrum of the salinity (0.4-28.5 {PSU}) and {pH} (5.87-8.06) gradients associated with this system. A total of 25 microalgal families of phytoplankton (including 22 diatom and seven dinoflagellate genera) and one of ciliates were recorded in the survey, which was carried out between August 2011 and June 2012. Phytoplankton density ranged from 7 to 9107 cells ml(-1). Diatoms were a dominant component of the communities, with Nitzschia spp., Rhizosolenia spp., and Leptocylindrus sp. reaching the highest abundances. Phytoplankton communities present at the four sampling stations differed significantly in terms of both algal abundance and composition and were strongly influenced by the effect of season (30\% of the total variance). The interactive effects of {pH} and salinity, and of {pH} and temperature, explained 16.7\% and 17.5\% of the total observed variation, respectively. A positive correlation between {pH} and the number of taxa found was detected. The functional diversity observed in phytoplankton from the Brunei River estuary was generally low with few taxa adapted well to the chronically low {pH} conditions. This study provides baseline data about structural and compositional changes in a tropical estuarine phytoplankton community associated with various levels of acidification of both natural and anthropogenic origins.},

The goal of this work was to learn more about the relationships between various components of the epiphytic community and its habitat. To examine diatoms at the microscale, four relatively well described sampling sites were chosen and analyses were performed on a large number of diatoms. All observations and counts were made with the scanning electron microscope. Samples collected in the same season but from different sites and under different sea and ice conditions differed significantly in terms of species composition, but all represented abundant and well-developed diatom communities. A list of species associated with P. antarctica from the investigated area is provided and the influence of the sampling effort on the observed diatom diversity is assessed.},

	abstract = {Epizoic diatoms form an important part of micro-epibiota of marine vertebrates such as whales and sea turtles. The present study explores and compares the diversity and biogeography of diatom communities growing on the skin and shell of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) from four different localities: Adriatic Sea (Croatia), Ionian Sea (Greece), South Africa and Florida Bay ({USA}) using both light and scanning electron microscopy. We observed almost 400 diatom taxa belonging to more than 100 genera. Diatom communities from Greece and Croatia showed the highest similarity and were statistically different from those recorded from South Africa and Florida. Part of this variation could be attributed to differences in sampling techniques; however, we believe that geography had an important role. In general, contrary to several previous observations from sea turtles, the presumably exclusively epizoic diatoms contributed less than common benthic taxa to the total diatom flora, which might have been related to the loggerhead feeding behavior. Moreover, skin samples differed from carapace samples in having a distinct diatom composition with a higher proportion of the putative true epizoonts. Our results indicate that epizoic diatom communities differ according to loggerhead geographical location and substrate (skin vs. carapace). The relative abundances of common benthic diatoms and putative exclusive epizoic taxa may inform about sea turtle habitat use or behavior though detailed comparisons among different host species have yet to be performed.},

	abstract = {The current study investigated diatom communities on juvenile green turtles foraging in neritic habitats around five Iranian islands. The primary objectives were to (1) compare species composition, growth form structure, and abundance of diatom communities associated with sea turtles foraging within the restricted boundaries of local feeding pastures, and (2) assess the level of uniqueness of the epizoic diatom flora in comparison with biofilms growing on floating debris. All observations and diatom counts were performed using scanning electron microscopy. The effect of the sampling location was apparent among sea turtle samples and reflected in significantly different cell densities. Diatom abundances were significantly higher on sea turtles (758–1836 cells mm−2) than on floating debris samples (9–189 cells mm−2). Epizoic diatom communities were composed of 20 diatom taxa and dominated by erect forms belonging to the so-called ‘marine gomphonemoids’, Chelonicola and Poulinea, previously reported on sea turtles from other geographical regions. The diatom flora found on floating debris was composed of 21 taxa. Only four taxa, Amphora cf. bigibba, Cocconeis cf. neothumensis var. marina, Psammodictyon constrictum, and Tabularia affinis, were recorded from both sea turtles and floating debris samples, and none of these exceeded 4\% of the average relative abundance on the sea turtle carapaces. The study reveals a clear substratum preference in sea turtle-associated diatoms, with no evidence for species turnover across the investigated region over different sampling seasons, thus confirming previous speculations that sea turtle diatom communities would show a high level of uniqueness and stability.},

	abstract = {Kelp forests are believed to host a large biomass of epiphytic fauna and flora, including diatoms, which constitute the base of aquatic food webs and play an important role in the transfer of energy to higher trophic levels. Epiphytic diatom assemblages associated with two common species of South African kelps, Ecklonia maxima and Laminaria pallida, were investigated in this study. Primary blades of adult and juvenile thalli of both kelp species were sampled at False Bay in July 2017 and analysed using scanning electron microscopy. Our findings showed that both kelp species hosted relatively low densities of diatoms (ranging from 7 [{SD} 5] cells mm−2 on adult specimens of L. pallida to 43 [{SD} 66] cells mm−2 on blades of juvenile E. maxima), with Amphora and Gomphoseptatum reaching the highest absolute abundances. Although non-metric multidimensional scaling showed overlapping and largely scattered sample sets, a significant relationship between the diatom communities and the species and age of the host macroalga was detected by two-way {PERMANOVA}. In general, more abundant and diverse diatom communities were observed on juvenile thalli than on adult thalli, with species belonging to Navicula and Rhoicosphenia contributing significantly to the observed dissimilarity. Due to a significant interaction between species and age effects, however, the overall ability of kelp species, their age, and their interaction to explain the variation in diatom community structure was limited. We suggest that the low densities of epiphytic diatoms were directly related to the sloughing of epithelial cells observed in both kelp species. We further speculate that on such unstable substrata some diatom taxa might adapt to an endophytic life to avoid the antifouling mechanisms developed by their hosts.},

Although studies on epizoic algae are relatively rare, and the function and role of those mainly photosynthetic organisms in the animal microbiome is not well understood, recent surveys on epizoic diatoms show that some of them exhibit traits of obligate epibionts. This study explores diatom communities on captive–born manatees from the Africarium in Wroclaw, Poland. Light and scanning electron microscopy analyses revealed that skin of all animals sampled was dominated by apochlorotic Tursiocola cf. ziemanii, an epizoic species described recently from Florida manatees, that reached 99,9\% of the total diatom abundance. Despite using media with a wide range of salinity (0–34), the isolated Tursiocola cells did not grow, whereas the normally pigmented Planothidium sp., that was only occasionally found on the animal substratum, survived in all culture media tested. Our observations provide direct evidence that manatee–associated Tursiocola endure the dramatic salinity changes that occur regularly during their host life cycle, and can thrive in an artificial captive setting, if the manatee substratum is available. The impact of practices and routines used by the Africarium on manatee–associated diatoms, as well as ultrastructure of areolae in Tursiocola, are briefly discussed.},

The genus is characterised by linear or lanceolate valves with well-developed pseudosepta at both poles, a valvocopula with three pairs of siliceous tabs, and a butterfly-like structure extending from the central nodule on the internal side of the valve. The current study describes a novel species of Tursiocola, T. neliana Majewska sp. nov. that grows epizoically on leatherback sea turtles from the Eastern Coast of South Africa based on detailed observations using light and scanning electron microscopy. The new taxon resembles the other currently known sea turtle-associated Tursiocola species in possessing relatively small, slightly heteropolar valves with acute apices and a strongly reduced butterfly structure on the internal side. However, T. neliana differs from all other members of the genus in being distinctly dorsiventral, with a clearly bowtie-shaped central area, unequal stria density on two sides of the raphe-sternum, and up to 8 areolae per stria. The description of the new taxon brings the total number of the sea turtle-associated Tursiocola species known so far up to four. An emended description of Tursiocola is proposed based on the new observations presented in this and other recent reports. Furthermore, the current understanding of the genus ecology is summarised.},

	abstract = {The Namib Desert is one of the world’s only truly coastal desert ecosystem. Until the end of the 1st decade of the twenty-first century, very little was known of the microbiology of this southwestern African desert, with the few reported studies being based solely on culture-dependent approaches. However, from 2010, an intense research program was undertaken by researchers from the University of the Western Cape Institute for Microbial Biotechnology and Metagenomics, and subsequently the University of Pretoria Centre for Microbial Ecology and Genomics, and their collaborators, led to a more detailed understanding of the ecology of the indigenous microbial communities in many Namib Desert biotopes. Namib Desert soils and the associated specialized niche communities are inhabited by a wide array of prokaryotic, lower eukaryotic and virus/phage taxa. These communities are highly heterogeneous on both small and large spatial scales, with community composition impacted by a range of macro- and micro-environmental factors, from water regime to soil particle size. Community functionality is also surprisingly non-homogeneous, with some taxa retaining functionality even under hyper-arid soil conditions, and with subtle changes in gene expression and phylotype abundances even on diel timescales. Despite the growing understanding of the structure and function of Namib Desert microbiomes, there remain enormous gaps in our knowledge. We have yet to quantify many of the processes in these soil communities, from regional nutrient cycling to community growth rates. Despite the progress that has been made, we still have little knowledge of either the role of phages in microbial community dynamics or inter-species interactions. Furthermore, the intense research efforts of the past decade have highlighted the immense scope for future microbiological research in this dynamic, enigmatic and charismatic region of Africa.},

It has been shown that living and fossil diatoms can be successfully used to track environmental changes in polar habitats. Nevertheless, the diatom flora of many Arctic areas remains unknown. The present study set out to examine the diatom flora in the rarely visited and near-pristine zone of northern Spitsbergen. Examination by light and scanning electron microscopy of 25 sediment samples, collected in fjords, tidal plains and lakes, indicated significant differences between the diatom assemblages identified in lakes located within different fjord watersheds. Altogether, 96 diatom taxa (46 genera) were found. The most abundant species (Achnanthidium minutissimum, Staurosirella pinnata and Nitzschia alpina) occurred in at least eight of the 11 investigated lakes. Assemblages from the Woodfjorden region were characterized by the presence of Cavinula pseudoscutiformis and Encyonema reichardtii, along with Navicula spp., which coincided with relatively low conductivity (34–58.7 µS cm−1) and near-neutral {pH} (7.2–7.5). Diatom assemblages found in the Wijdefjorden area were typically characterized by Denticula kuetzingii and Nitzschia inconspicua, with these lakes generally having higher water conductivity ({\textgreater}184 µS cm−1) and {pH} (7.5–8.1) conditions. Conductivity, biogenic silica concentration and water temperature were indicated as significant predictors of diatom community species composition and structure. No diatom frustules were found in fjord and tidal plain sediments. The effects of selected environmental factors on diatom assemblage formation are discussed.},

The porous, highly symmetrical structure and microscopic size of diatom cell walls make them ideal constituents of sensing devices and analytical chips. Here, we propose chemical methods to purify diatom frustules extracted from diatomaceous earth. Using photo deposition techniques, we grow gold nanoparticles on the surface of diatom skeletons and within the pores of the skeletons, where the size and density of nanoparticles can be controlled by changing the parameters of the synthesis. Resulting devices have an internal porous structure that can harvest molecules from a solution, and an external shell of gold nanoparticles that amplifies the electromagnetic field generated by the measurement laser in Raman or other spectroscopies. The combination of these effects enables the analysis of biological specimens, chemical analytes and pollutants in extremely low abundance ranges. The devices were demonstrated in the analysis of Bovine Serum Albumin in water with a concentration of 100 {aM}, and mineral oil with a concentration of 50 ppm.},

Three of the examined taxa, C. danayanus sp. nov., C. legouvelloanus sp. nov., and C. macewanii sp. nov., are described based on morphological and, whenever possible, molecular characteristics. The new taxa exhibit characters not previously observed in other members of the genus, such as the presence of more than two rows of cribrate areolae on the girdle bands, shallow perforated septa, and a complete reduction of the stauros. The fourth species, C. alatus, itself recently described from museum sea turtle specimens, is reported for the first time from loggerhead sea turtles rescued in Europe. A 3-gene phylogenetic analysis including {DNA} sequence data for three sea turtle-associated Craspedostauros species and other marine and epizoic diatom taxa indicated that Craspedostauros is monophyletic and sister to Achnanthes. This study, being based on a large number of samples and animal specimens analyzed and using different preservation and processing methods, provides new insights into the ecology and biogeography of the genus and sheds light on the level of intimacy and permanency in the host–epibiont interaction within the epizoic Craspedostauros species.},

The phylogenetic relationships among Anorthoneis taxa were investigated based on morphological characters using a maximum parsimony method. This analysis indicated a large, well-supported clade that included taxa that exhibited similarities in external and internal details of the central areas in both raphe-sternum and sternum valves. Revealed synapomorphies within the genus include externally and internally transversely dilated central area on both sides of the raphe-sternum valve, externally transversely dilated central area on both sides of the sternum valve, sternum valve striae parallel at the center and radiate at the apices, and areolae with hymenes in both valves. During a survey a new species Anorthoneis arthus-bertrandii sp. nov., was found on seagrass leaves collected from Siladen Island (Indonesia). This taxon is sister to A. hyalina, but can be easily differentiated from the latter by smaller valve dimensions, central area size and shape, and rota-like vela occluding sternum valve areolae - a feature that has never been observed in other Anorthoneis taxa.},

	abstract = {Although diatoms colonize a vast diversity of immersed hard-surfaced objects and organisms, many diatom species, and sometimes entire genera, show a clear preference towards a particular type of substratum. Studies of animal-associated diatoms indicate that some epizoic forms may require this specific habitat to thrive, and new diatom taxa are expected to be found on as yet unexplored animal hosts. The current study is the first to investigate the diatom flora of sea snakes. Three museum specimens of yellow-bellied sea snakes (Hydrophis platurus) collected over a period of 23 years from the south-eastern coast of South Africa were examined for their diatom flora. Diatoms were abundant on the sea snakes, but communities were composed of only a few species. A previously undescribed species of Nagumoea contributed over 99\% of the total diatom assemblage on both the sea snake skin and sea-snake-associated barnacles (Octolasmis sp.). This diatom dominant is described here as Nagumoea hydrophicola sp. nov., based on detailed observations of its frustule ultrastructure using light and scanning electron microscopy. The species is most similar to N. serrata, sharing a similar valvocopula morphology with two rows of pores. However, it can be distinguished from all currently known congeners by its lanceolate central area, short distal raphe endings not reaching the valve mantle, and doubly perforated abvalvar girdle bands. Environmental preferences of the new species are discussed in the context of its host’s biology.},

	abstract = {Diatom community composition and abundances on different thallus parts of adult and juvenile specimens of Eckloniamaxima and Laminariapallida were examined in False Bay, South Africa, using light and scanning electron microscopy. Altogether, 288 thallus portions were analysed. Diatom abundances ranged from 0 to 404 cells mm\&minus;2 and were generally higher on E. maxima and juvenile thalli than L. pallida and adult specimens. Moreover, diatom abundances differed between the various thallus parts, being highest on the upper blade and lowest on the primary blade. A total of 48 diatom taxa belonging to 28 genera were found. Gomphoseptatum Medlin, Nagumoea Witkowski and Kociolek, Cocconeis Ehrenberg, and Navicula Bory were the most frequently occurring genera, being present in 84\%, 65\%, 62.5\%, and 45\% of the analysed samples, respectively. Among these, Cocconeis and Gomphoseptatum were the most abundant, contributing 50\% and 27\% of total diatom cells counted collectively across all samples. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance ({PERMANOVA}) revealed that all investigated main factors (kelp species and age and thallus part), as well as their two- and three-way interactions, except for the interaction between the host species and age, were significant. The high residual variance (72\%) indicated that the sum of other unexamined factors contributed the largest component of the variation observed in the kelp-associated diatom communities, and grazing and possible defence strategies utilised by kelps are proposed as processes playing an important role in the structuring of epiphytic diatom communities. Possible endophytism of tissue-boring diatoms colonizing both kelp species is briefly discussed.},

However, most of the research has focused on carapace-associated taxa and communities, while less is known about diatoms growing on sea turtle skin. The current study investigated diatom diversity on the skin of loggerhead sea turtle heads detached from the carcasses found along the Adriatic coast between 1995 and 2004 and stored frozen for a prolonged period of time. By using both light and scanning electron microscopy we have found diatom frustules in 7 out of 14 analysed sea turtle samples. Altogether, 113 diatom taxa were recorded, with a minimum of seven and a maximum of 35 taxa per sample. Eight taxa, Achnanthes elongata, Berkeleya cf. fennica, Chelonicola sp., Licmophora hyalina, Nagumoea sp., Navicula sp., Nitzschia cf. lanceolata, and Poulinea lepidochelicola exceeded 5\% of relative abundance in any one sample. The presumably obligately epizoic diatom taxa, A. elongata, Chelonicola sp., and P. lepidochelicola, dominated in six loggerhead samples, contributing up to 97.1\% of the total diatom abundance. These observations suggest that on the sea turtle skin highly specialised taxa gain even greater ecological advantage and dominance over the co-occurring benthic forms than in the carapace biofilms. The suitability of frozen sea turtle skin specimens for diatom analysis and limitations of this approach are discussed.},

The primary objectives of the workshop were to present the current state of knowledge on sea turtle epibiosis research to an interdisciplinary community and to collectively develop a standardized epibiont sampling methodology for improved data sharing among scientists. The talking points of the workshop discussion included: 1.) clarifying the utility of published epibiont lists, 2.) articulating a functional understanding of interspecies connections between sea turtles and epibionts, 3.) framing the need for an open-access, global epibiont database, 4.) developing a repository for collected material accessible to all workers in the field, and 5.) employing hypothesis testing in epibiont research, and 6.) envisioning long-term monitoring plans to advance the study of sea turtle epibiosis.},

The two molecular clades corresponded to two morphological groups, with Hyalosira obtusangula associated with Grammatophoraceae. We emend the description and provide lectotypification for Hyalosira and propose Placosira to encompass the taxa in the other clade, associated with Rhabdonemataceae. We propose that Hyalosira has uniseriate to triseriate striae, sometimes different on valve face and mantle. Copulae in most species had shallow septa, though in one they were moderately deep. All species had girdle bands bearing two rows of areolae separated by a midrib. We name five new species of Hyalosira. Morphologies of taxa in the Placosira clade were superficially similar to Hyalosira but differed in having areolae with ricae, a single row of areolae on the girdle bands, and tubular rimoportulae on the valve-face-mantle junction. Hyalosira hustedtiana Patrick should revert to its original position in Striatella until the appropriate genus can be determined.

	abstract = {Epiphytic diatoms are one of the key biotic elements of the Antarctic marine ecosystem. Their unusually high metabolic flexibility gives them a crucial role in the Antarctic trophic chain. Despite being fundamental to the ecosystem functioning, diatom communities associated with marine macroalgae are frequently ignored in the floristic studies of the area. Few attempts to investigate substrate preferences have been reported. The present study provides the first examination and description of the epiphytic diatom flora from Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica). Material was collected during Italian Antarctic campaigns in the years 1989–2005. Samples of thalli of Iridaea cordata, Phyllophora Antarctica, and Plocamium cartilagineum were taken from different depths at five sampling sites localized along the shore. All observations have been carried out under the scanning electron microscope. The genus Cocconeis was the most common. Two identified, previously described and well known from the Antarctic waters species – Cocconeis antiqua and C. fasciolata, as well as small naviculoid species (most likely Navicula perminuta), appeared in abundance. The Cocconeis component of the assemblage was estimated to approach 105 cells per cm2 on foliose hosts such as Iridaea. Melosira adelie was the only non-pennate diatom to achieve any degree of dominance, although Paralia sol and Trigonium arcticum were common on some of the filamentous parts of host macroalgae. Our results indicate a strong relation between the diatom assemblages and the sampling site. There is no clear evidence of diatoms host specificity. However, the filamentous forms as well as topographic anomalies (e.g. colonies of hydroids or bryozoans) can provide a point of attachment for a wider range of taxa.},

	abstract = {The animal/plant associated microbiota play a key role in the survival and fitness of their hosts. The microbial communities associated with the host’s body, both on the external surfaces and inside the guts, support their host's immune system and provide protection from pathogens. Although sea turtles have been studied by marine biologists over the last decades and even centuries, many aspects of their biology and ecology remain poorly understood. In spite of the presumed importance and essential role of micro-symbionts in their host’s physiology and wellbeing, there are major knowledge gaps on the sea turtle associated microbiota. Very little is known about microbes inhabiting the sea turtle intestines, whereas, to our knowledge, no reports exist on the sea turtle epibiotic bacteria. Novel findings show that sea turtles harbor unique and abundant communities of microscopic algae called diatoms. Sea turtle- associated diatoms colonize the surface of tissues, both skin and carapace and new taxa have been described worldwide from all sea turtle species. Recently, we launched the "{TurtleBIOME} project", a study that would allow us to obtain the very first complete description of sea turtle microbial biodiversity. “{TurtleBIOME} project” is the Installation Grant Research project funded by Croatian Science Fund that will operate over a 5-year period, from 2018 – 2023. A detailed investigation of microbial composition of the surface biofilm and the gut microbiome of Mediterranean population of loggerhead sea turtles will be performed using a combination of the culture-independent molecular characterization of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms, a classical approach of microbial cultivation, and morphological observations of the biofilm. Our research team is a group of scientists with extensive experience in various subjects, including turtle biology, diatom taxonomy and microbial ecology. We believe, the proposed study will provide baseline information on the loggerhead microbiome that can then be integrated with the existing knowledge on sea turtle biology, eco- physiology, and behavior. Furthermore, our research may open many new avenues for future investigations focused on co-evolution and biogeography of microbial epi- and endo-bionts and their hosts, as well as the capacity of the sea turtle-associated microbes to function as bioindicators of their host’s behavior and health.},

	abstract = {Epibiotic communities of sea turtles have been subjected to growing scientific interest in the recent years. A variety of animals and photosynthetic organisms, such as crustaceans, annelids, molluscs or macroalgae, are well known to live as macro-epibionts on the sea turtle body surfaces. Some of these organisms require animal substrate to live and develop and their survival is intricately linked to the survival of the host species. However, as has recently been shown, sea turtles also host unique communities of diatoms – siliceous unicellular algae with several taxa, including newly described genera (e.g. Chelonicola, Medlinella, Poulinea) and species (e.g. Achnanthes elongata, A. squaliformis, Labellicula lecohuiana, Tursiocola denysii), known exclusively from the carapaces and skin of different marine turtle species, such as olive ridley, green turtle, and loggerhead. The scope of our study was to confirm or refute the presence of the epizoic diatom flora on the skin of loggerhead sea turtles found in the Adriatic Sea. We collected skin samples from the frozen necks and heads of 14 different loggerheads obtained between 1995 and 2002. The scrapings were processed with strong acids (sulfuric and nitric), which allowed to remove the organic matter and revealed the inorganic components of the samples, such as silica frustules of diatoms. The light ({LM}) and scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}) observations confirmed that 50\% of the samples contained diatoms. In {LM} 25 morphologically different taxa were recognized. The majority of them occurred in low abundances. The {SEM} analysis revealed that the dominating diatom species were epizoic Achnathes elongata and Poulinea cf. lepidochelicola with the later species representing ca. 70\% of diatoms in five samples. Poulinea species have been often recorded from skin and carapace samples of five other sea turtle species collected from various locations across the world. Detailed investigations on both morphological and molecular characteristics of different populations of Poulinea and other “so-called “marine gomphonemoids” (including Chelonicola and Tripterion) may indicate an evolutionary relationship among these epizoic microalgae and shed some light on dispersal modes and colonization strategies used by marine microbes.},

	abstract = {The examination of a m-sized macro-algal thallus of Sargassum aquifolium recovered in the South China Sea 60 km off Brunei Darussalam, revealed a rafting community of numerous living, symbiont-bearing, Larger Benthic Foraminifera ({LBF}), clearly adapted to epiphytic life. The dominant species are: 1. Amphisorus hemprichii that shows both flat growth on "leaves" and curved, "encrusting" growth, folding around rods of Sargassum. 2. Encrusting Formaminifera Planorbulina acervalis, well known to be epiphytic. We also found Calcarina calcar, Baculogypsina sp. and small Benthic Foraminifera in minor numbers. The Amphisorus juveniles show a flat morphology and adults progressively warp as chambers are added to adapt to the surface of algal rods. Sargassum aquifolium is an epilithic macro-alga common in the tropical Indo-West Pacific. Rocky shores are, however, rare along the N-Borneo coast, where this algae, though poorly studied, has not been reported. Amphisorus has not been found by {AB} in Brunei near-shore samples. It is likely that the thallus has drifted for a long time in the off-shore currents of the South China Sea. {SEM}-observation of algal rods with attached {LBF}, fixed in ethanol on board ship, reveal a rich epiphytic diatom community dominated by Cocconeis spp. and including other genera, such as Amphora, Nitzschia, Mastogloia etc. Many frustules are embedded in bacterial clusters. We found numerous diatom frustules engulfed in pseudopodial protoplasm extending from the apertural face of Amphisorus, suggesting feeding by external digestion of diatom soft parts. Our observations suggest that symbiont-bearing {LBF} can feed, grow and possibly reproduce in an auto-sufficient, floating, epiphytic community, which potentially allows them to disperse along the major surface currents of the world oceans. Once stranded in a suitable shallow-water environment, the community may have a sufficiently large gene pool to settle an evolve, adapting to the local environment. This observation may be key to the dispersal of shallow dwelling {LBF}, both in the Recent and the Late Mesozoic-Cainozoic, which has been poorly understood. Largely unconstrained hypotheses of the direction of {LBF}- migration, between the Tethyan, the American and the Indo-Pacific provinces, were based on supposed ancestor-descendant relationships between related taxa in the respective provinces.},

the cost and any possible environmental footprint of a similarly extensive study involving fieldwork and fresh material collection. 
Selected samples of both dried and liquid-preserved specimens of aquatic animals collected from locations across the different ocean basins were analysed for their associated diatom communities. 
Whenever possible, a few cm2 tissue sample was digested with acids to extract the diatom valves. In several cases, to avoid the destruction of the especially valuable animal tissue, samples were placed in separate beakers with distilled water and sonicated for ca. 30 minutes. Subsequently, the water 
with detached diatoms was collected, while the animal samples were air-dried and returned to the collection manager. Cleaned diatom frustules were examined using both light and scanning electron microscopy. Altogether 100+ samples were processed. The analysis proved that although zoological 
museum collections may indeed constitute an excellent source of unique and often very rich epizoic diatom material, several important limitations of such study must be considered. The advantages and disadvantages of the research approach will be critically assessed and discussed.},

	abstract = {Two new species of the previously monospecific diatom genus Druehlago were discovered during the ongoing studies exploring the epizoic and epiphytic diatom flora of the Southern African coasts. These species are formally described here as D. craspedostauriformis sp. nov. and D. lobbanii sp. nov. Detailed morphological examination using both light and scanning electron microscopy revealed wedge-shaped frustules with a central constriction containing multiple lenticular chloroplasts, as well as heteropolar valves with wider headpoles and biarcuate raphes, typical of Druehlago. A stauros narrower than the fascia, a feature not yet reported from Druehlago but typical of the morphologically similar genus Craspedostauros, was observed in D. craspedostauriformis. Apart from the presence of a stauros, the latter species can be easily distinguished from other Druehlago members by its large size, low stria density, externally raised raphe-sternum, and girdle bands with a crenate pars interior. Although the gross morphology of D. lobbanii strongly resembled that of D. cuneata, the two species can be distinguished based on clear differences in size and stria density. Moreover, whereas shallow septa run along the almost entire length of the girdle bands in D. cuneata, they are absent in D. lobbanii. Based on the new findings and observations, the taxonomic status of the genus Druehlago and its morphological and ecological similarity to Craspedostauros and Achnanthes are discussed and evaluated.},
